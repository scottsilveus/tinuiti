This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
This will also start a mocked graphql server on http://localhost:5000/ using
the json-graphql-server package.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

ApolloClient was used to interact with the mocked graphql server. You are able to use ApolloClient for state management, but I had some difficulty getting it working
